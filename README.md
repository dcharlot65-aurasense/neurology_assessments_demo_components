Aurasense aims to develop web-based gamified experiences to enable tracking of neurological health without the need for highly specialized equipment or the need to travel far to interact with a care specialist.

This is a repo of full functioning components that enable the implementation of a java-script based demo.

Files separated by basic testing for debug and actual implemented experiences. 

Have fun playing with the code and learning a thing or two about the benefits of bioengineering, systems engineering, and AI.

Thanks to all the public repos willing to share their knowledge to make this possible.
